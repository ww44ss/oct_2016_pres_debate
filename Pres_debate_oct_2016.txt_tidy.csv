"1","RADDATZ"," ladies and gentlemen the republican nominee for president donald j trump and the democratic nominee for president hillary clinton "
"2","COOPER"," thank you very much for being here we re going to begin with a question from one of the members in our town hall each of you will have two minutes to respond to this question secretary clinton you won the coin toss so you ll go first our first question comes from patrice brock patrice "
"3","AUDIENCE"," thank you and good evening the last debate could have been rated as mature audiences per parental guidelines knowing that educators assign viewing the presidential debates as students homework do you feel you re modeling appropriate and positive behavior for today s youth "
"4","CLINTON"," well thank you are you a teacher yes i think that that s a very good question because i ve heard from lots of teachers and parents about some of their concerns about some of the things that are being said and done in this campaign "
"5","CLINTON","and i think it is very important for us to make clear to our children that our country really is great because we re good and we are going to respect one another lift each other up we are going to be looking for ways to celebrate our diversity and we are going to try to reach out to every boy and girl as well as every adult to bring them in to working on behalf of our country "
"6","CLINTON","i have a very positive and optimistic view about what we can do together that s why the slogan of my campaign is stronger together because i think if we work together if we overcome the divisiveness that sometimes sets americans against one another and instead we make some big goals and i ve set forth some big goals getting the economy to work for everyone not just those at the top making sure that we have the best education system from preschool through college and making it affordable and so much else "
"7","CLINTON","if we set those goals and we go together to try to achieve them there s nothing in my opinion that america can t do so that s why i hope that we will come together in this campaign obviously i m hoping to earn your vote i m hoping to be elected in november and i can promise you i will work with every american "
"8","CLINTON","i want to be the president for all americans regardless of your political beliefs where you come from what you look like your religion i want us to heal our country and bring it together because that s i think the best way for us to get the future that our children and our grandchildren deserve "
"9","COOPER"," secretary clinton thank you mr trump you have two minutes "
"10","TRUMP"," well i actually agree with that i agree with everything she said i began this campaign because i was so tired of seeing such foolish things happen to our country this is a great country this is a great land i ve gotten to know the people of the country over the last year and a half that i ve been doing this as a politician i cannot believe i m saying that about myself but i guess i have been a politician "
"11","TRUMP","and my whole concept was to make america great again when i watch the deals being made when i watch what s happening with some horrible things like obamacare where your health insurance and health care is going up by numbers that are astronomical percent percent percent when i look at the iran deal and how bad a deal it is for us it s a one sided transaction where we re giving back billion to a terrorist state really the number one terror state we ve made them a strong country from really a very weak country just three years ago "
"12","TRUMP","when i look at all of the things that i see and all of the potential that our country has we have such tremendous potential whether it s in business and trade where we re doing so badly last year we had almost billion trade deficit in other words trading with other countries we had an billion deficit it s hard to believe inconceivable "
"13","TRUMP","you say who s making these deals we re going the make great deals we re going to have a strong border we re going to bring back law and order just today policemen was shot two killed and this is happening on a weekly basis we have to bring back respect to law enforcement at the same time we have to take care of people on all sides we need justice "
"14","TRUMP","but i want to do things that haven t been done including fixing and making our inner cities better for the african american citizens that are so great and for the latinos hispanics and i look forward to doing it it s called make america great again "
"15","COOPER"," thank you mr trump the question from patrice was about are you both modeling positive and appropriate behavior for today s youth we received a lot of questions online mr trump about the tape that was released on friday as you can imagine you called what you said locker room banter you described kissing women without consent grabbing their genitals that is sexual assault you bragged that you have sexually assaulted women do you understand that "
"16","TRUMP"," no i didn t say that at all i don t think you understood what was this was locker room talk i m not proud of it i apologize to my family i apologize to the american people certainly i m not proud of it but this is locker room talk "
"17","TRUMP","you know when we have a world where you have isis chopping off heads where you have and frankly drowning people in steel cages where you have wars and horrible horrible sights all over where you have so many bad things happening this is like medieval times we haven t seen anything like this the carnage all over the world "
"18","TRUMP","and they look and they see can you imagine the people that are frankly doing so well against us with isis and they look at our country and they see what s going on "
"19","TRUMP","yes i m very embarrassed by it i hate it but it s locker room talk and it s one of those things i will knock the hell out of isis we re going to defeat isis isis happened a number of years ago in a vacuum that was left because of bad judgment and i will tell you i will take care of isis "
"20","COOPER"," so mr trump"
"21","TRUMP"," and we should get on to much more important things and much bigger things "
"22","COOPER"," just for the record though are you saying that what you said on that bus years ago that you did not actually kiss women without consent or grope women without consent "
"23","TRUMP"," i have great respect for women nobody has more respect for women than i do "
"24","COOPER"," so for the record you re saying you never did that "
"25","TRUMP"," i ve said things that frankly you hear these things i said and i was embarrassed by it but i have tremendous respect for women "
"26","COOPER"," have you ever done those things "
"27","TRUMP"," and women have respect for me and i will tell you no i have not and i will tell you that i m going to make our country safe we re going to have borders in our country which we don t have now people are pouring into our country and they re coming in from the middle east and other places "
"28","TRUMP","we re going to make america safe again we re going to make america great again but we re going to make america safe again and we re going to make america wealthy again because if you don t do that it just it sounds harsh to say but we have to build up the wealth of our nation "
"29","COOPER"," thank you mr trump "
"30","TRUMP"," right now other nations are taking our jobs and they re taking our wealth "
"31","COOPER"," thank you mr trump "
"32","TRUMP"," and that s what i want to talk about "
"33","COOPER"," secretary clinton do you want to respond "
"34","CLINTON"," well like everyone else i ve spent a lot of time thinking over the last hours about what we heard and saw you know with prior republican nominees for president i disagreed with them on politics policies principles but i never questioned their fitness to serve "
"35","CLINTON","donald trump is different i said starting back in june that he was not fit to be president and commander in chief and many republicans and independents have said the same thing what we all saw and heard on friday was donald talking about women what he thinks about women what he does to women and he has said that the video doesn t represent who he is "
"36","CLINTON","but i think it s clear to anyone who heard it that it represents exactly who he is because we ve seen this throughout the campaign we have seen him insult women we ve seen him rate women on their appearance ranking them from one to ten we ve seen him embarrass women on and on twitter we saw him after the first debate spend nearly a week denigrating a former miss universe in the harshest most personal terms "
"37","CLINTON","so yes this is who donald trump is but it s not only women and it s not only this video that raises questions about his fitness to be our president because he has also targeted immigrants african americans latinos people with disabilities pows muslims and so many others "
"38","CLINTON","so this is who donald trump is and the question for us the question our country must answer is that this is not who we are that s why to go back to your question i want to send a message we all should to every boy and girl and indeed to the entire world that america already is great but we are great because we are good and we will respect one another and we will work with one another and we will celebrate our diversity "
"39","CLINTON","these are very important values to me because this is the america that i know and love and i can pledge to you tonight that this is the america that i will serve if i m so fortunate enough to become your president "
"40","RADDATZ"," and we want to get to some questions from online"
"41","TRUMP"," am i allowed to respond to that i assume i am "
"42","RADDATZ"," yes you can respond to that "
"43","TRUMP"," it s just words folks it s just words those words i ve been hearing them for many years i heard them when they were running for the senate in new york where hillary was going to bring back jobs to upstate new york and she failed "
"44","TRUMP","i ve heard them where hillary is constantly talking about the inner cities of our country which are a disaster education wise jobwise safety wise in every way possible i m going to help the african americans i m going to help the latinos hispanics i am going to help the inner cities "
"45","TRUMP","she s done a terrible job for the african americans she wants their vote and she does nothing and then she comes back four years later we saw that firsthand when she was united states senator she campaigned where the primary part of her campaign"
"46","RADDATZ"," mr trump mr trump i want to get to audience questions and online questions "
"47","TRUMP"," so she s allowed to do that but i m not allowed to respond "
"48","RADDATZ"," you re going to have you re going to get to respond right now "
"49","TRUMP"," sounds fair "
"50","RADDATZ"," this tape is generating intense interest in just hours it s become the single most talked about story of the entire election on facebook with millions and millions of people discussing it on the social network as we said a moment ago we do want to bring in questions from voters around country via social media and our first stays on this topic jeff from ohio asks on facebook trump says the campaign has changed him when did that happen so mr trump let me add to that when you walked off that bus at age were you a different man or did that behavior continue until just recently and you have two minutes for this "
"51","TRUMP"," it was locker room talk as i told you that was locker room talk i m not proud of it i am a person who has great respect for people for my family for the people of this country and certainly i m not proud of it but that was something that happened "
"52","TRUMP","if you look at bill clinton far worse mine are words and his was action his was what he s done to women there s never been anybody in the history politics in this nation that s been so abusive to women so you can say any way you want to say it but bill clinton was abusive to women "
"53","TRUMP","hillary clinton attacked those same women and attacked them viciously four of them here tonight one of the women who is a wonderful woman at years old was raped at her client she represented got him off and she s seen laughing on two separate occasions laughing at the girl who was raped kathy shelton that young woman is here with us tonight "
"54","TRUMP","so don t tell me about words i am absolutely i apologize for those words but it is things that people say but what president clinton did he was impeached he lost his license to practice law he had to pay an fine to one of the women paula jones who s also here tonight "
"55","TRUMP","and i will tell you that when hillary brings up a point like that and she talks about words that i said years ago i think it s disgraceful and i think she should be ashamed of herself if you want to know the truth "
"56","RADDATZ"," can we please hold the applause secretary clinton you have two minutes "
"57","CLINTON"," well first let me start by saying that so much of what he s just said is not right but he gets to run his campaign any way he chooses he gets to decide what he wants to talk about instead of answering people s questions talking about our agenda laying out the plans that we have that we think can make a better life and a better country that s his choice "
"58","CLINTON","when i hear something like that i am reminded of what my friend michelle obama advised us all when they go low you go high "
"59","CLINTON","and look if this were just about one video maybe what he s saying tonight would be understandable but everyone can draw their own conclusions at this point about whether or not the man in the video or the man on the stage respects women but he never apologizes for anything to anyone "
"60","CLINTON","he never apologized to mr and mrs khan the gold star family whose son captain khan died in the line of duty in iraq and donald insulted and attacked them for weeks over their religion "
"61","CLINTON","he never apologized to the distinguished federal judge who was born in indiana but donald said he couldn t be trusted to be a judge because his parents were quote mexican "
"62","CLINTON","he never apologized to the reporter that he mimicked and mocked on national television and our children were watching and he never apologized for the racist lie that president obama was not born in the united states of america he owes the president an apology he owes our country an apology and he needs to take responsibility for his actions and his words "
"63","TRUMP"," well you owe the president an apology because as you know very well your campaign sidney blumenthal he s another real winner that you have and he s the one that got this started along with your campaign manager and they were on television just two weeks ago she was saying exactly that so you really owe him an apology you re the one that sent the pictures around your campaign sent the pictures around with president obama in a certain garb that was long before i was ever involved so you actually owe an apology "
"64","TRUMP","number two michelle obama i ve gotten to see the commercials that they did on you and i ve gotten to see some of the most vicious commercials i ve ever seen of michelle obama talking about you hillary "
"65","TRUMP","so you talk about friend go back and take a look at those commercials a race where you lost fair and square unlike the bernie sanders race where you won but not fair and square in my opinion and all you have to do is take a look at wikileaks and just see what they say about bernie sanders and see what deborah wasserman schultz had in mind because bernie sanders between super delegates and deborah wasserman schultz he never had a chance and i was so surprised to see him sign on with the devil "
"66","TRUMP","but when you talk about apology i think the one that you should really be apologizing for and the thing that you should be apologizing for are the emails that you deleted and that you acid washed and then the two boxes of emails and other things last week that were taken from an office and are now missing "
"67","TRUMP","and i ll tell you what i didn t think i d say this but i m going to say it and i hate to say it but if i win i am going to instruct my attorney general to get a special prosecutor to look into your situation because there has never been so many lies so much deception there has never been anything like it and we re going to have a special prosecutor "
"68","TRUMP","when i speak i go out and speak the people of this country are furious in my opinion the people that have been long term workers at the are furious there has never been anything like this where emails and you get a subpoena you get a subpoena and after getting the subpoena you delete emails and then you acid wash them or bleach them as you would say very expensive process "
"69","TRUMP","so we re going to get a special prosecutor and we re going to look into it because you know what people have been their lives have been destroyed for doing one fifth of what you ve done and it s a disgrace and honestly you ought to be ashamed of yourself "
"70","RADDATZ"," secretary clinton i want to follow up on that "
"71","RADDATZ"," i m going to let you talk about emails "
"72","CLINTON"," because everything he just said is absolutely false but i m not surprised "
"73","TRUMP"," oh really "
"74","CLINTON"," in the first debate"
"75","RADDATZ"," and really the audience needs to calm down here "
"76","CLINTON"," i told people that it would be impossible to be fact checking donald all the time i d never get to talk about anything i want to do and how we re going to really make lives better for people "
"77","CLINTON","so once again go to hillaryclinton com we have literally trump you can fact check him in real time last time at the first debate we had millions of people fact checking so i expect we ll have millions more fact checking because you know it is it s just awfully good that someone with the temperament of donald trump is not in charge of the law in our country "
"78","TRUMP"," because you d be in jail "
"79","RADDATZ"," secretary clinton"
"80","COOPER"," we want to remind the audience to please not talk out loud please do not applaud you re just wasting time "
"81","RADDATZ"," and secretary clinton i do want to follow up on e mails you ve said your handing of your emails was a mistake you disagreed with director james comey calling your handling of classified information quote extremely careless the said that there were classified emails that were exchanged eight of which were top secret and that it was possible hostile actors did gain access to those emails you don t call that extremely careless "
"82","CLINTON"," well martha first let me say and i ve said before but i ll repeat it because i want everyone to hear it that was a mistake and i take responsibility for using a personal email account obviously if i were to do it over again i would not i m not making any excuses it was a mistake and i am very sorry about that "
"83","CLINTON","but i think it s also important to point out where there are some misleading accusations from critics and others after a year long investigation there is no evidence that anyone hacked the server i was using and there is no evidence that anyone can point to at all anyone who says otherwise has no basis that any classified material ended up in the wrong hands "
"84","CLINTON","i take classified materials very seriously and always have when i was on the senate armed services committee i was privy to a lot of classified material obviously as secretary of state i had some of the most important secrets that we possess such as going after bin laden so i am very committed to taking classified information seriously and as i said there is no evidence that any classified information ended up in the wrong hands "
"85","RADDATZ"," okay we re going to move on "
"86","TRUMP"," and yet she didn t know the word the letter c on a document right she didn t even know what that word what that letter meant "
"87","TRUMP","you know it s amazing i m watching hillary go over facts and she s going after fact after fact and she s lying again because she said she you know what she did with the email was fine you think it was fine to delete emails i don t think so "
"88","TRUMP","she said the emails had to do with her daughter s wedding number one and a yoga class well maybe we ll give three or three or four or five or something emails deleted and now she s saying there wasn t anything wrong "
"89","TRUMP","and more importantly that was after getting a subpoena that wasn t before that was after she got it from the united states congress and i ll be honest i am so disappointed in congressmen including republicans for allowing this to happen "
"90","TRUMP","our justice department where our husband goes on to the back of a airplane for minutes talks to the attorney general days before a ruling is going to be made on her case but for you to say that there was nothing wrong with you deleting emails again you should be ashamed of yourself what you did and this is after getting a subpoena from the united states congress "
"91","COOPER"," we have to move on "
"92","TRUMP"," you did that wait a minute one second "
"93","COOPER"," secretary clinton you can respond and then we got to move on "
"94","RADDATZ"," we want to give the audience a chance "
"95","TRUMP"," if you did that in the private sector you d be put in jail let alone after getting a subpoena from the united states congress "
"96","COOPER"," secretary clinton you can respond then we have to move on to an audience question "
"97","CLINTON"," look it s just not true and so please go to"
"98","TRUMP"," oh you didn t delete them "
"99","COOPER"," allow her to respond please "
"100","CLINTON"," it was personal emails not official "
"101","TRUMP"," oh yeah "
"102","CLINTON"," not well we turned over so"
"103","TRUMP"," oh yeah what about the other "
"104","COOPER"," please allow her to respond she didn t talk while you talked "
"105","CLINTON"," yes that s true i didn t "
"106","TRUMP"," because you have nothing to say "
"107","CLINTON"," i didn t in the first debate and i m going to try not to in this debate because i d like to get to the questions that the people have brought here tonight to talk to us about "
"108","TRUMP"," get off this question "
"109","CLINTON"," okay donald i know you re into big diversion tonight anything to avoid talking about your campaign and the way it s exploding and the way republicans are leaving you but let s at least focus"
"110","TRUMP"," let s see what happens"
"111","COOPER"," allow her to respond "
"112","CLINTON"," on some of the issues that people care about tonight let s get to their questions "
"113","COOPER"," we have a question here from ken karpowicz he has a question about health care ken "
"114","TRUMP"," i d like to know anderson why aren t you bringing up the emails i d like to know why aren t you bringing"
"115","COOPER"," we brought up the emails "
"116","TRUMP"," no it hasn t it hasn t and it hasn t been finished at all "
"117","COOPER"," ken karpowicz has a question "
"118","TRUMP"," it s nice to one on three "
"119","AUDIENCE"," thank you affordable care act known as obamacare it is not affordable premiums have gone up deductibles have gone up copays have gone up prescriptions have gone up and the coverage has gone down what will you do to bring the cost down and make coverage better "
"120","COOPER"," that first one goes to secretary clinton because you started out the last one to the audience "
"121","CLINTON"," if he wants to start he can start no go ahead donald "
"122","TRUMP"," no i m a gentlemen hillary go ahead "
"123","COOPER"," secretary clinton "
"124","CLINTON"," well i think donald was about to say he s going to solve it by repealing it and getting rid of the affordable care act and i m going to fix it because i agree with you premiums have gotten too high copays deductibles prescription drug costs and i ve laid out a series of actions that we can take to try to get those costs down "
"125","CLINTON","but here s what i don t want people to forget when we re talking about reining in the costs which has to be the highest priority of the next president when the affordable care act passed it wasn t just that million got insurance who didn t have it before but that in and of itself was a good thing i meet these people all the time and they tell me what a difference having that insurance meant to them and their families "
"126","CLINTON","but everybody else the million of us who get health insurance through our employees got big benefits number one insurance companies can t deny you coverage because of a pre existing condition number two no lifetime limits which is a big deal if you have serious health problems "
"127","CLINTON","number three women can t be charged more than men for our health insurance which is the way it used to be before the affordable care act number four if you re under and your parents have a policy you can be on that policy until the age of something that didn t happen before "
"128","CLINTON","so i want very much to save what works and is good about the affordable care act but we ve got to get costs down we ve got to provide additional help to small businesses so that they can afford to provide health insurance but if we repeal it as donald has proposed and start over again all of those benefits i just mentioned are lost to everybody not just people who get their health insurance on the exchange and then we would have to start all over again "
"129","CLINTON","right now we are at percent health insurance coverage that s the highest we ve ever been in our country "
"130","COOPER"," secretary clinton your time is up "
"131","CLINTON"," so i want us to get to percent but get costs down and keep quality up "
"132","COOPER"," mr trump you have two minutes "
"133","TRUMP"," it is such a great question and it s maybe the question i get almost more than anything else outside of defense obamacare is a disaster you know it we all know it it s going up at numbers that nobody s ever seen worldwide nobody s ever seen numbers like this for health care "
"134","TRUMP","it s only getting worse in it implodes by itself their method of fixing it is to go back and ask congress for more money more and more money we have right now almost trillion in debt "
"135","TRUMP","obamacare will never work it s very bad very bad health insurance far too expensive and not only expensive for the person that has it unbelievably expensive for our country it s going to be one of the biggest line items very shortly "
"136","TRUMP","we have to repeal it and replace it with something absolutely much less expensive and something that works where your plan can actually be tailored we have to get rid of the lines around the state artificial lines where we stop insurance companies from coming in and competing because they want and president obama and whoever was working on it they want to leave those lines because that gives the insurance companies essentially monopolies we want competition "
"137","TRUMP","you will have the finest health care plan there is she wants to go to a single payer plan which would be a disaster somewhat similar to canada and if you haven t noticed the canadians when they need a big operation when something happens they come into the united states in many cases because their system is so slow it s catastrophic in certain ways "
"138","TRUMP","but she wants to go to single payer which means the government basically rules everything hillary clinton has been after this for years obamacare was the first step obamacare is a total disaster and not only are your rates going up by numbers that nobody s ever believed but your deductibles are going up so that unless you get hit by a truck you re never going to be able to use it "
"139","COOPER"," mr trump your time"
"140","TRUMP"," it is a disastrous plan and it has to be repealed and replaced "
"141","COOPER"," secretary clinton let me follow up with you your husband called obamacare quote the craziest thing in the world saying that small business owners are getting killed as premiums double coverage is cut in half was he mistaken or was the mistake simply telling the truth "
"142","CLINTON"," no i mean he clarified what he meant and it s very clear look we are in a situation in our country where if we were to start all over again we might come up with a different system but we have an employer based system that s where the vast majority of people get their health care "
"143","CLINTON","and the affordable care act was meant to try to fill the gap between people who were too poor and couldn t put together any resources to afford health care namely people on medicaid obviously medicare which is a single payer system which takes care of our elderly and does a great job doing it by the way and then all of the people who were employed but people who were working but didn t have the money to afford insurance and didn t have anybody an employer or anybody else to help them "
"144","CLINTON","that was the slot that the obamacare approach was to take and like i say million people now have health insurance so if we just rip it up and throw it away what donald s not telling you is we just turn it back to the insurance companies the way it used to be and that means the insurance companies"
"145","COOPER"," secretary clinton"
"146","CLINTON"," get to do pretty much whatever they want including saying look i m sorry you ve got diabetes you had cancer your child has asthma"
"147","COOPER"," your time is up "
"148","CLINTON"," you may not be able to have insurance because you can t afford it so let s fix what s broken about it but let s not throw it away and give it all back to the insurance companies and the drug companies that s not going to work "
"149","COOPER"," mr trump let me follow up on this "
"150","TRUMP"," well i just want just one thing first of all hillary everything s broken about it everything number two bernie sanders said that hillary clinton has very bad judgment this is a perfect example of it trying to save obamacare which is a disaster "
"151","COOPER"," you ve said you want to end obamacare"
"152","TRUMP"," by the way"
"153","COOPER"," you ve said you want to end obamacare you ve also said you want to make coverage accessible for people with pre existing conditions how do you force insurance companies to do that if you re no longer mandating that every american get insurance "
"154","TRUMP"," we re going to be able to you re going to have plans"
"155","COOPER"," what does that mean "
"156","TRUMP"," well i ll tell you what it means you re going to have plans that are so good because we re going to have so much competition in the insurance industry once we break out once we break out the lines and allow the competition to come"
"157","COOPER"," are you going are you going to have a mandate that americans have to have health insurance "
"158","TRUMP"," president obama anderson excuse me president obama by keeping those lines the boundary lines around each state it was almost gone until just very toward the end of the passage of obamacare which by the way was a fraud you know that because jonathan gruber the architect of obamacare was said he said it was a great lie it was a big lie president obama said you keep your doctor you keep your plan the whole thing was a fraud and it doesn t work "
"159","TRUMP","but when we get rid of those lines you will have competition and we will be able to keep pre existing we ll also be able to help people that can t get don t have money because we are going to have people protected "
"160","TRUMP","and republicans feel this way believe it or not and strongly this way we re going to block grant into the states we re going to block grant into medicaid into the states"
"161","COOPER"," thank you mr trump "
"162","TRUMP"," so that we will be able to take care of people without the necessary funds to take care of themselves "
"163","COOPER"," thank you mr trump "
"164","RADDATZ"," we now go to gorbah hamed with a question for both candidates "
"165","AUDIENCE"," hi there are million muslims in the united states and i m one of them you ve mentioned working with muslim nations but with islamophobia on the rise how will you help people like me deal with the consequences of being labeled as a threat to the country after the election is over "
"166","RADDATZ"," mr trump you re first "
"167","TRUMP"," well you re right about islamophobia and that s a shame but one thing we have to do is we have to make sure that because there is a problem i mean whether we like it or not and we could be very politically correct but whether we like it or not there is a problem and we have to be sure that muslims come in and report when they see something going on when they see hatred going on they have to report it "
"168","TRUMP","as an example in san bernardino many people saw the bombs all over the apartment of the two people that killed and wounded many many people horribly wounded they ll never be the same muslims have to report the problems when they see them "
"169","TRUMP","and you know there s always a reason for everything if they don t do that it s a very difficult situation for our country because you look at orlando and you look at san bernardino and you look at the world trade center go outside look at paris look at that horrible these are radical islamic terrorists "
"170","TRUMP","and she won t even mention the word and nor will president obama he won t use the term radical islamic terrorism now to solve a problem you have to be able to state what the problem is or at least say the name she won t say the name and president obama won t say the name but the name is there it s radical islamic terror and before you solve it you have to say the name "
"171","RADDATZ"," secretary clinton "
"172","CLINTON"," well thank you for asking your question and i ve heard this question from a lot of muslim americans across our country because unfortunately there s been a lot of very divisive dark things said about muslims and even someone like captain khan the young man who sacrificed himself defending our country in the united states army has been subject to attack by donald "
"173","CLINTON","i want to say just a couple of things first we ve had muslims in america since george washington and we ve had many successful muslims we just lost a particular well known one with muhammad ali "
"174","CLINTON","my vision of america is an america where everyone has a place if you re willing to work hard you do your part you contribute to the community that s what america is that s what we want america to be for our children and our grandchildren "
"175","CLINTON","it s also very short sighted and even dangerous to be engaging in the kind of demagogic rhetoric that donald has about muslims we need american muslims to be part of our eyes and ears on our front lines i ve worked with a lot of different muslim groups around america i ve met with a lot of them and i ve heard how important it is for them to feel that they are wanted and included and part of our country part of our homeland security and that s what i want to see "
"176","CLINTON","it s also important i intend to defeat isis to do so in a coalition with majority muslim nations right now a lot of those nations are hearing what donald says and wondering why should we cooperate with the americans and this is a gift to isis and the terrorists violent jihadist terrorists "
"177","CLINTON","we are not at war with islam and it is a mistake and it plays into the hands of the terrorists to act as though we are so i want a country where citizens like you and your family are just as welcome as anyone else "
"178","RADDATZ"," thank you secretary clinton "
"179","RADDATZ","mr trump in december you said this donald j trump is calling for a total and complete shutdown of muslims entering the united states until our country s representatives can figure out what the hell is going on we have no choice we have no choice your running mate said this week that the muslim ban is no longer your position is that correct and if it is was it a mistake to have a religious test "
"180","TRUMP"," first of all captain khan is an american hero and if i were president at that time he would be alive today because unlike her who voted for the war without knowing what she was doing i would not have had our people in iraq iraq was disaster so he would have been alive today "
"181","TRUMP","the muslim ban is something that in some form has morphed into a extreme vetting from certain areas of the world hillary clinton wants to allow hundreds of thousands excuse me excuse me "
"182","RADDATZ"," and why did it morph into that no did you no answer the question do you still believe"
"183","TRUMP"," why don t you her you me all the time "
"184","RADDATZ"," i do "
"185","TRUMP"," why don t you her "
"186","RADDATZ"," would you please explain whether or not the muslim ban still stands "
"187","TRUMP"," it s called extreme vetting we are going to areas like syria where they re coming in by the tens of thousands because of barack obama and hillary clinton wants to allow a percent increase over obama people are coming into our country like we have no idea who they are where they are from what their feelings about our country is and she wants percent more this is going to be the great trojan horse of all time "
"188","TRUMP","we have enough problems in this country i believe in building safe zones i believe in having other people pay for them as an example the gulf states who are not carrying their weight but they have nothing but money and take care of people but i don t want to have with all the problems this country has and all of the problems that you see going on hundreds of thousands of people coming in from syria when we know nothing about them we know nothing about their values and we know nothing about their love for our country "
"189","RADDATZ"," and secretary clinton let me ask you about that because you have asked for an increase from to syrian refugees we know you want tougher vetting that s not a perfect system so why take the risk of having those refugees come into the country "
"190","CLINTON"," well first of all i will not let anyone into our country that i think poses a risk to us but there are a lot of refugees women and children think of that picture we all saw of that year old boy with the blood on his forehead because he d been bombed by the russian and syrian air forces "
"191","CLINTON","there are children suffering in this catastrophic war largely i believe because of russian aggression and we need to do our part we by no means are carrying anywhere near the load that europe and others are but we will have vetting that is as tough as it needs to be from our professionals our intelligence experts and others "
"192","CLINTON","but it is important for us as a policy you know not to say as donald has said we re going to ban people based on a religion how do you do that we are a country founded on religious freedom and liberty how do we do what he has advocated without causing great distress within our own county are we going to have religious tests when people fly into our country and how do we expect to be able to implement those "
"193","CLINTON","so i thought that what he said was extremely unwise and even dangerous and indeed you can look at the propaganda on a lot of the terrorists sites and what donald trump says about muslims is used to recruit fighters because they want to create a war between us "
"194","CLINTON","and the final thing i would say this is the th or th time that he s denied being for the war in iraq we have it on tape the entire press corps has looked at it it s been debunked but it never stops him from saying whatever he wants to say "
"195","TRUMP"," that s not been debunked "
"196","CLINTON"," so please"
"197","TRUMP"," that has not been debunked "
"198","CLINTON"," go to hillaryclinton com and you can see it "
"199","TRUMP"," i was against i was against the war in iraq has not been debunked and you voted for it and you shouldn t have well i just want to say"
"200","RADDATZ"," there s been lots of fact checking on that i d like to move on to an online question"
"201","TRUMP"," excuse me she just went about seconds over her time "
"202","RADDATZ"," she did not "
"203","TRUMP"," could i just respond to this please "
"204","RADDATZ"," very quickly please "
"205","TRUMP"," hillary clinton in terms of having people come into our country we have many criminal illegal aliens when we want to send them back to their country their country says we don t want them in some cases they re murderers drug lords drug problems and they don t want them "
"206","TRUMP","and hillary clinton when she was secretary of state said that s okay we can t force it into their country let me tell you i m going to force them right back into their country they re murderers and some very bad people "
"207","TRUMP","and i will tell you very strongly when bernie sanders said she had bad judgment she has really bad judgment because we are letting people into this country that are going to cause problems and crime like you ve never seen we re also letting drugs pour through our southern border at a record clip at a record clip and it shouldn t be allowed to happen "
"208","TRUMP","ice just endorsed me they ve never endorsed a presidential candidate the border patrol agents just recently endorsed me and they endorsed me because i understand the border she doesn t she wants amnesty for everybody come right in come right over it s a horrible thing she s doing she s got bad judgment and honestly so bad that she should never be president of the united states that i can tell you "
"209","RADDATZ"," thank you mr trump i want to move on this next question from the public through the bipartisan open debate coalition s online forum where americans submitted questions that generated millions of votes this question involves wikileaks release of purported excerpts of secretary clinton s paid speeches which she has refused to release and one line in particular in which you secretary clinton purportedly say you need both a public and private position on certain issues so tu from virginia asks is it for politicians to be two faced is it acceptable for a politician to have a private stance on issues secretary clinton your two minutes "
"210","CLINTON"," well right as i recall that was something i said about abraham lincoln after having seen the wonderful steven spielberg movie called lincoln it was a master class watching president lincoln get the congress to approve the th amendment it was principled and it was strategic "
"211","CLINTON","and i was making the point that it is hard sometimes to get the congress to do what you want to do and you have to keep working at it and yes president lincoln was trying to convince some people he used some arguments convincing other people he used other arguments that was a great i thought a great display of presidential leadership "
"212","CLINTON","but you know let s talk about what s really going on here martha because our intelligence community just came out and said in the last few days that the kremlin meaning putin and the russian government are directing the attacks the hacking on american accounts to influence our election and wikileaks is part of that as are other sites where the russians hack information we don t even know if it s accurate information and then they put it out "
"213","CLINTON","we have never in the history of our country been in a situation where an adversary a foreign power is working so hard to influence the outcome of the election and believe me they re not doing it to get me elected they re doing it to try to influence the election for donald trump "
"214","CLINTON","now maybe because he has praised putin maybe because he says he agrees with a lot of what putin wants to do maybe because he wants to do business in moscow i don t know the reasons but we deserve answers and we should demand that donald release all of his tax returns so that people can see what are the entanglements and the financial relationships that he has"
"215","RADDATZ"," we re going to get to that later secretary clinton you re out of time "
"216","CLINTON"," with the russians and other foreign powers "
"217","RADDATZ"," mr trump "
"218","TRUMP"," well i think i should respond because so ridiculous look now she s blaming she got caught in a total lie her papers went out to all her friends at the banks goldman sachs and everybody else and she said things wikileaks that just came out and she lied now she s blaming the lie on the late great abraham lincoln that s one that i haven t"
"219","TRUMP","okay honest abe honest abe never lied that s the good thing that s the big difference between abraham lincoln and you that s a big big difference we re talking about some difference "
"220","TRUMP","but as far as other elements of what she was saying i don t know putin i think it would be great if we got along with russia because we could fight isis together as an example but i don t know putin "
"221","TRUMP","but i notice anytime anything wrong happens they like to say the russians are she doesn t know if it s the russians doing the hacking maybe there is no hacking but they always blame russia and the reason they blame russia because they think they re trying to tarnish me with russia i know nothing about russia i know i know about russia but i know nothing about the inner workings of russia i don t deal there i have no businesses there i have no loans from russia "
"222","TRUMP","i have a very very great balance sheet so great that when i did the old post office on pennsylvania avenue the united states government because of my balance sheet which they actually know very well chose me to do the old post office between the white house and congress chose me to do the old post office one of the primary area things in fact perhaps the primary thing was balance sheet but i have no loans with russia you could go to the united states government and they would probably tell you that because they know my sheet very well in order to get that development i had to have "
"223","TRUMP","now the taxes are a very simple thing as soon as i have first of all i pay hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes many of her friends took bigger deductions warren buffett took a massive deduction soros who s a friend of hers took a massive deduction many of the people that are giving her all this money that she can do many more commercials than me gave her took massive deductions "
"224","TRUMP","i pay hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes but but as soon as my routine audit is finished i ll release my returns i ll be very proud to they re actually quite great "
"225","RADDATZ"," thank you mr trump "
"226","COOPER"," we want to turn actually to the topic of taxes we have a question from spencer maass spencer "
"227","AUDIENCE"," good evening my question is what specific tax provisions will you change to ensure the wealthiest americans pay their fair share in taxes "
"228","COOPER"," mr trump you have two minutes "
"229","TRUMP"," well one thing i d do is get rid of carried interest one of the greatest provisions for people like me to be honest with you i give up a lot when i run because i knock out the tax code and she could have done this years ago by the way she s a united states she was a united states senator "
"230","TRUMP","she complains that donald trump took advantage of the tax code well why didn t she change it why didn t you change it when you were a senator the reason you didn t is that all your friends take the same advantage that i do and i do you have provisions in the tax code that frankly we could change but you wouldn t change it because all of these people gave you the money so you can take negative ads on donald trump "
"231","TRUMP","but and i say that about a lot of things you know i ve heard hillary complaining about so many different things over the years i wish you would have done this but she s been there for years she s been doing this stuff she never changed and she never will change she never will change "
"232","TRUMP","we re getting rid of carried interest provisions i m lowering taxes actually because i think it s so important for corporations because we have corporations leaving massive corporations and little ones little ones can t form we re getting rid of regulations which goes hand in hand with the lowering of the taxes "
"233","TRUMP","but we re bringing the tax rate down from percent to percent we re cutting taxes for the middle class and i will tell you we are cutting them big league for the middle class "
"234","TRUMP","and i will tell you hillary clinton is raising your taxes folks you can look at me she s raising your taxes really high and what that s going to do is a disaster for the country but she is raising your taxes and i m lowering your taxes that in itself is a big difference we are going to be thriving again we have no growth in this country there s no growth if china has a of percent it s like a national catastrophe we re down at percent and that s like no growth and we re going lower in my opinion and a lot of it has to do with the fact that our taxes are so high just about the highest in the world and i m bringing them down to one of the lower in the world and i think it s so important one of the most important things we can do but she is raising everybody s taxes massively "
"235","COOPER"," secretary clinton you have two minutes the question was what specific tax provisions will you change to ensure the wealthiest americans pay their fair share of taxes "
"236","CLINTON"," well everything you ve heard just now from donald is not true i m sorry i have to keep saying this but he lives in an alternative reality and it is sort of amusing to hear somebody who hasn t paid federal income taxes in maybe years talking about what he s going to do "
"237","CLINTON","but i ll tell you what he s going to do his plan will give the wealthy and corporations the biggest tax cuts they ve ever had more than the bush tax cuts by at least a factor of two donald always takes care of donald and people like donald and this would be a massive gift and indeed the way that he talks about his tax cuts would end up raising taxes on middle class families millions of middle class families "
"238","CLINTON","now here s what i want to do i have said nobody who makes less than a year and that s the vast majority of americans as you know will have their taxes raised because i think we ve got to go where the money is and the money is with people who have taken advantage of every single break in the tax code "
"239","CLINTON","and yes when i was a senator i did vote to close corporate loopholes i voted to close i think one of the loopholes he took advantage of when he claimed a billion dollar loss that enabled him to avoid paying taxes "
"240","CLINTON","i want to have a tax on people who are making a million dollars it s called the buffett rule yes warren buffett is the one who s gone out and said somebody like him should not be paying a lower tax rate than his secretary i want to have a surcharge on incomes above million "
"241","CLINTON","we have to make up for lost times because i want to invest in you i want to invest in hard working families and i think it s been unfortunate but it s happened that since the great recession the gains have all gone to the top and we need to reverse that "
"242","CLINTON","people like donald who paid zero in taxes zero for our vets zero for our military zero for health and education that is wrong "
"243","COOPER"," thank you secretary "
"244","CLINTON"," and we re going to make sure that nobody no corporation and no individual can get away without paying his fair share to support our country "
"245","COOPER"," thank you i want to give you mr trump i want to give you the chance to respond i just wanted to tell our viewers what she s referring to in the last month taxes were the number one issue on facebook for the first time in the campaign the new york times published three pages of your tax returns they show you claimed a million loss which means you could have avoided paying personal federal income taxes for years you ve said you pay state taxes employee taxes real estate taxes property taxes you have not answered though a simple question did you use that million loss to avoid paying personal federal income taxes for years "
"246","TRUMP"," of course i do of course i do and so do all of her donors or most of her donors i know many of her donors her donors took massive tax write offs "
"247","COOPER"," so have you paid personal federal income tax "
"248","TRUMP"," a lot of my excuse me anderson a lot of my write off was depreciation and other things that hillary as a senator allowed and she ll always allow it because the people that give her all this money they want it that s why "
"249","TRUMP","see i understand the tax code better than anybody that s ever run for president hillary clinton and it s extremely complex hillary clinton has friends that want all of these provisions including they want the carried interest provision which is very important to wall street people but they really want the carried interest provision which i believe hillary s leaving very interesting why she s leaving carried interest "
"250","TRUMP","but i will tell you that number one i pay tremendous numbers of taxes i absolutely used it and so did warren buffett and so did george soros and so did many of the other people that hillary is getting money from now i won t mention their names because they re rich but they re not famous so we won t make them famous "
"251","COOPER"," so can you can you say how many years you have avoided paying personal federal income taxes "
"252","TRUMP"," no but i pay tax and i pay federal tax too but i have a write off a lot of it s depreciation which is a wonderful charge i love depreciation you know she s given it to us "
"253","TRUMP","hey if she had a problem for years she s been doing this anderson i say it all the time she talks about health care why didn t she do something about it she talks about taxes why didn t she do something about it she doesn t do anything about anything other than talk with her it s all talk and no action "
"254","COOPER"," in the past"
"255","TRUMP"," and again bernie sanders it s really bad judgment she has made bad judgment not only on taxes she s made bad judgments on libya on syria on iraq i mean her and obama whether you like it or not the way they got out of iraq the vacuum they ve left that s why isis formed in the first place they started from that little area and now they re in different nations hillary congratulations great job "
"256","COOPER"," secretary i want you to be able to respond secretary clinton "
"257","CLINTON"," well here we go again i ve been in favor of getting rid of carried interest for years starting when i was a senator from new york but that s not the point here "
"258","TRUMP"," why didn t you do it why didn t you do it "
"259","COOPER"," allow her to respond "
"260","CLINTON"," because i was a senator with a republican president "
"261","TRUMP"," oh really "
"262","CLINTON"," i will be the president and we will get it done that s exactly right "
"263","TRUMP"," you could have done it if you were an effective if you were an effective senator you could have done it if you were an effective senator you could have done it but you were not an effective senator "
"264","COOPER"," please allow her to respond she didn t you "
"265","CLINTON"," you know under our constitution presidents have something called veto power look he has now said repeatedly years this and years that so let me talk about my years in public service i m very glad to do so "
"266","CLINTON","eight million kids every year have health insurance because when i was first lady i worked with democrats and republicans to create the children s health insurance program hundreds of thousands of kids now have a chance to be adopted because i worked to change our adoption and foster care system after i went to work with republican mayor governor and president to rebuild new york and to get health care for our first responders who were suffering because they had run toward danger and gotten sickened by it hundreds of thousands of national guard and reserve members have health care because of work that i did and children have safer medicines because i was able to pass a law that required the dosing to be more carefully done "
"267","CLINTON","when i was secretary of state i went around the world advocating for our country but also advocating for women s rights to make sure that women had a decent chance to have a better life and negotiated a treaty with russia to lower nuclear weapons four hundred pieces of legislation have my name on it as a sponsor or cosponsor when i was a senator for eight years "
"268","CLINTON","i worked very hard and was very proud to be re elected in new york by an even bigger margin than i had been elected the first time and as president i will take that work that bipartisan work that finding common ground because you have to be able to get along with people to get things done in washington "
"269","COOPER"," thank you secretary "
"270","CLINTON"," i ve proven that i can and for years i ve produced results for people "
"271","COOPER"," thank you secretary "
"272","RADDATZ"," we re going to move on to syria both of you have mentioned that "
"273","TRUMP"," she said a lot of things that were false i mean i think we should be allowed to maybe"
"274","RADDATZ"," no we can no mr trump we re going to go on this is about the audience "
"275","TRUMP"," excuse me because she has been a disaster as a senator a disaster "
"276","RADDATZ"," mr trump we re going to move on the heart breaking video of a year old syrian boy named omran sitting in an ambulance after being pulled from the rubble after an air strike in aleppo focused the world s attention on the horrors of the war in syria with million views on facebook alone "
"277","RADDATZ","but there are much worse images coming out of aleppo every day now where in the past few weeks alone people have been killed at least of them children just days ago the state department called for a war crimes investigation of the syrian regime of bashar al assad and its ally russia for their bombardment of aleppo "
"278","RADDATZ","so this next question comes through social media through facebook diane from pennsylvania asks if you were president what would you do about syria and the humanitarian crisis in aleppo isn t it a lot like the holocaust when the u s waited too long before we helped secretary clinton we will begin with your two minutes "
"279","CLINTON"," well the situation in syria is catastrophic and every day that goes by we see the results of the regime by assad in partnership with the iranians on the ground the russians in the air bombarding places in particular aleppo where there are hundreds of thousands of people probably about still left and there is a determined effort by the russian air force to destroy aleppo in order to eliminate the last of the syrian rebels who are really holding out against the assad regime "
"280","CLINTON","russia hasn t paid any attention to isis they re interested in keeping assad in power so i when i was secretary of state advocated and i advocate today a no fly zone and safe zones we need some leverage with the russians because they are not going to come to the negotiating table for a diplomatic resolution unless there is some leverage over them and we have to work more closely with our partners and allies on the ground "
"281","CLINTON","but i want to emphasize that what is at stake here is the ambitions and the aggressiveness of russia russia has decided that it s all in in syria and they ve also decided who they want to see become president of the united states too and it s not me i ve stood up to russia i ve taken on putin and others and i would do that as president "
"282","CLINTON","i think wherever we can cooperate with russia that s fine and i did as secretary of state that s how we got a treaty reducing nuclear weapons it s how we got the sanctions on iran that put a lid on the iranian nuclear program without firing a single shot so i would go to the negotiating table with more leverage than we have now but i do support the effort to investigate for crimes war crimes committed by the syrians and the russians and try to hold them accountable "
"283","RADDATZ"," thank you secretary clinton mr trump "
"284","TRUMP"," first of all she was there as secretary of state with the so called line in the sand which"
"285","CLINTON"," no i wasn t i was gone i hate to you but at some point"
"286","TRUMP"," but you were in contact excuse me you were"
"287","CLINTON"," at some point we need to do some fact checking here "
"288","TRUMP"," you were in total contact with the white house and perhaps sadly obama probably still listened to you i don t think he would be listening to you very much anymore "
"289","TRUMP","obama draws the line in the sand it was laughed at all over the world what happened "
"290","TRUMP","now with that being said she talks tough against russia but our nuclear program has fallen way behind and they ve gone wild with their nuclear program not good our government shouldn t have allowed that to happen russia is new in terms of nuclear we are old we re tired we re exhausted in terms of nuclear a very bad thing "
"291","TRUMP","now she talks tough she talks really tough against putin and against assad she talks in favor of the rebels she doesn t even know who the rebels are you know every time we take rebels whether it s in iraq or anywhere else we re arming people and you know what happens they end up being worse than the people "
"292","TRUMP","look at what she did in libya with gadhafi gadhafi s out it s a mess and by the way isis has a good chunk of their oil i m sure you probably have heard that it was a disaster because the fact is almost everything she s done in foreign policy has been a mistake and it s been a disaster "
"293","TRUMP","but if you look at russia just take a look at russia and look at what they did this week where i agree she wasn t there but possibly she s consulted we sign a peace treaty everyone s all excited well what russia did with assad and by the way with iran who you made very powerful with the dumbest deal perhaps i ve ever seen in the history of deal making the iran deal with the billion with the billion in cash which is enough to fill up this room "
"294","TRUMP","but look at that deal iran now and russia are now against us so she wants to fight she wants to fight for rebels there s only one problem you don t even know who the rebels are so what s the purpose "
"295","RADDATZ"," mr trump mr trump your two minutes is up "
"296","TRUMP"," and one thing i have to say "
"297","RADDATZ"," your two minutes is up "
"298","TRUMP"," i don t like assad at all but assad is killing isis russia is killing isis and iran is killing isis and those three have now lined up because of our weak foreign policy "
"299","RADDATZ"," mr trump let me repeat the question if you were presidentwhat would you do about syria and the humanitarian crisis in aleppo and i want to remind you what your running mate said he said provocations by russia need to be met with american strength and that if russia continues to be involved in air strikes along with the syrian government forces of assad the united states of america should be prepared to use military force to strike the military targets of the assad regime "
"300","TRUMP"," he and i haven t spoken and i disagree i disagree "
"301","RADDATZ"," you disagree with your running mate "
"302","TRUMP"," i think you have to knock out isis right now syria is fighting isis we have people that want to fight both at the same time but syria is no longer syria syria is russia and it s iran who she made strong and kerry and obama made into a very powerful nation and a very rich nation very very quickly very very quickly "
"303","TRUMP","i believe we have to get isis we have to worry about isis before we can get too much more involved she had a chance to do something with syria they had a chance and that was the line and she didn t "
"304","RADDATZ"," what do you think will happen if aleppo falls "
"305","TRUMP"," i think aleppo is a disaster humanitarian wise "
"306","RADDATZ"," what do you think will happen if it falls "
"307","TRUMP"," i think that it basically has fallen it basically has fallen let me tell you something you take a look at mosul the biggest problem i have with the stupidity of our foreign policy we have mosul they think a lot of the isis leaders are in mosul so we have announcements coming out of washington and coming out of iraq we will be attacking mosul in three weeks or four weeks "
"308","TRUMP","well all of these bad leaders from isis are leaving mosul why can t they do it quietly why can t they do the attack make it a sneak attack and after the attack is made inform the american public that we ve knocked out the leaders we ve had a tremendous success people leave why do they have to say we re going to be attacking mosul within the next four to six weeks which is what they re saying how stupid is our country "
"309","RADDATZ"," there are sometimes reasons the military does that psychological warfare "
"310","TRUMP"," i can t think of any i can t think of any and i m pretty good at it "
"311","RADDATZ"," it might be to help get civilians out "
"312","TRUMP"," and we have general flynn and we have look i have generals and admirals who endorsed me i have congressional medal of honor recipients who endorsed me we talk about it all the time they understand why can t they do something secretively where they go in and they knock out the leadership how why would these people stay there i ve been reading now"
"313","RADDATZ"," tell me what your strategy is "
"314","TRUMP"," for weeks i ve been reading now for weeks about mosul that it s the harbor of where you know between raqqa and mosul this is where they think the isis leaders are why would they be saying they re not staying there anymore they re gone because everybody s talking about how iraq which is us with our leadership goes in to fight mosul "
"315","TRUMP","now with these admirals and generals they can t believe it all i say is this general george patton general douglas macarthur are spinning in their grave at the stupidity of what we re doing in the middle east "
"316","RADDATZ"," i m going to go to secretary clinton secretary clinton you want assad to go you advocated arming rebels but it looks like that may be too late for aleppo you talk about diplomatic efforts those have failed cease fires have failed would you introduce the threat of u s military force beyond a no fly zone against the assad regime to back up diplomacy "
"317","CLINTON"," i would not use american ground forces in syria i think that would be a very serious mistake i don t think american troops should be holding territory which is what they would have to do as an occupying force i don t think that is a smart strategy "
"318","CLINTON","i do think the use of special forces which we re using the use of enablers and trainers in iraq which has had some positive effects are very much in our interests and so i do support what is happening but let me just"
"319","RADDATZ"," but what would you do differently than president obama is doing "
"320","CLINTON"," well martha i hope that by the time i if i m fortunate"
"321","TRUMP"," everything "
"322","CLINTON"," i hope by the time i am president that we will have pushed isis out of iraq i do think that there is a good chance that we can take mosul and you know donald says he knows more about isis than the generals no he doesn t "
"323","CLINTON","there are a lot of very important planning going on and some of it is to signal to the sunnis in the area as well as kurdish peshmerga fighters that we all need to be in this and that takes a lot of planning and preparation "
"324","CLINTON","i would go after baghdadi i would specifically target baghdadi because i think our targeting of al qaida leaders and i was involved in a lot of those operations highly classified ones made a difference so i think that could help "
"325","CLINTON","i would also consider arming the kurds the kurds have been our best partners in syria as well as iraq and i know there s a lot of concern about that in some circles but i think they should have the equipment they need so that kurdish and arab fighters on the ground are the principal way that we take raqqa after pushing isis out of iraq "
"326","RADDATZ"," thank you very much we re going to move on"
"327","TRUMP"," you know what s funny she went over a minute over and you don t stop her when i go one second over it s like a big deal "
"328","RADDATZ"," you had many answers "
"329","TRUMP"," it s really it s really very interesting "
"330","COOPER"," we ve got a question over here from james carter mr carter "
"331","AUDIENCE"," my question is do you believe you can be a devoted president to all the people in the united states "
"332","COOPER"," that question begins for mr trump "
"333","TRUMP"," absolutely i mean she calls our people deplorable a large group and irredeemable i will be a president for all of our people and i ll be a president that will turn our inner cities around and will give strength to people and will give economics to people and will bring jobs back "
"334","TRUMP","because signed by her husband is perhaps the greatest disaster trade deal in the history of the world not in this country it stripped us of manufacturing jobs we lost our jobs we lost our money we lost our plants it is a disaster and now she wants to sign even though she says now she s for it she called it the gold standard and by the way at the last debate she lied because it turned out that she did say the gold standard and she said she didn t say it they actually said that she lied and she lied but she s lied about a lot of things "
"335","TRUMP","i would be a president for all of the people african americans the inner cities devastating what s happening to our inner cities she s been talking about it for years as usual she talks about it nothing happens she doesn t get it done "
"336","TRUMP","same with the latino americans the hispanic americans the same exact thing they talk they don t get it done you go into the inner cities and you see it s percent poverty african americans now percent poverty in the inner cities the education is a disaster jobs are essentially nonexistent "
"337","TRUMP","i mean it s you know and i ve been saying at big speeches where i have and people what do you have to lose it can t get any worse and she s been talking about the inner cities for years nothing s going to ever happen "
"338","TRUMP","let me tell you if she s president of the united states nothing s going to happen it s just going to be talk and all of her friends the taxes we were talking about and i would just get it by osmosis she s not doing any me favors but by doing all the others favors she s doing me favors "
"339","COOPER"," mr trump thank you "
"340","TRUMP"," but i will tell you she s all talk it doesn t get done all you have to do is take a look at her senate run take a look at upstate new york "
"341","COOPER"," your two minutes is up secretary clinton two minutes "
"342","TRUMP"," it turned out to be a disaster "
"343","COOPER"," you have two minutes secretary clinton "
"344","CLINTON"," well percent of the people voted to re elect me when i ran for my second term and i was very proud and very humbled by that "
"345","CLINTON","mr carter i have tried my entire life to do what i can to support children and families you know right out of law school i went to work for the children s defense fund and donald talks a lot about you know the years i ve been in public service i m proud of that you know i started off as a young lawyer working against discrimination against african american children in schools and in the criminal justice system i worked to make sure that kids with disabilities could get a public education something that i care very much about i have worked with latinos one of my first jobs in politics was down in south texas registering latino citizens to be able to vote so i have a deep devotion to use your absolutely correct word to making sure that an every american feels like he or she has a place in our country "
"346","CLINTON","and i think when you look at the letters that i get a lot of people are worried that maybe they wouldn t have a place in donald trump s america they write me and one woman wrote me about her son felix she adopted him from ethiopia when he was a toddler he s years old now this is the only one country he s ever known and he listens to donald on and he said to his mother one day will he send me back to ethiopia if he gets elected "
"347","CLINTON","you know children listen to what is being said to go back to the very very first question and there s a lot of fear in fact teachers and parents are calling it the trump effect bullying is up a lot of people are feeling you know uneasy a lot of kids are expressing their concerns "
"348","CLINTON","so first and foremost i will do everything i can to reach out to everybody "
"349","COOPER"," your time secretary clinton "
"350","CLINTON"," democrats republicans independents people across our country if you don t vote for me i still want to be your president "
"351","COOPER"," your two minutes is up "
"352","CLINTON"," i want to be the best president i can be for every american "
"353","COOPER"," secretary clinton your two minutes is up i want to follow up on something that donald trump actually said to you a comment you made last month you said that half of donald trump s supporters are quote deplorables racist sexist homophobic xenophobic islamophobic you later said you regretted saying half you didn t express regret for using the term deplorables to mr carter s question how can you unite a country if you ve written off tens of millions of americans "
"354","CLINTON"," well within hours i said that i was sorry about the way i talked about that because my argument is not with his supporters it s with him and with the hateful and divisive campaign that he has run and the inciting of violence at his rallies and the very brutal kinds of comments about not just women but all americans all kinds of americans "
"355","CLINTON","and what he has said about african americans and latinos about muslims about pows about immigrants about people with disabilities he s never apologized for and so i do think that a lot of the tone and tenor that he has said i m proud of the campaign that bernie sanders and i ran we ran a campaign based on issues not insults and he is supporting me percent "
"356","COOPER"," thank you "
"357","CLINTON"," because we talked about what we wanted to do we might have had some differences and we had a lot of debates"
"358","COOPER"," thank you secretary "
"359","TRUMP"," but we believed that we could make the country better and i was proud of that "
"360","COOPER"," i want to give you a minute to respond "
"361","TRUMP"," we have a divided nation we have a very divided nation you look at charlotte you look at baltimore you look at the violence that s taking place in the inner cities chicago you take a look at washington d c "
"362","TRUMP","we have an increase in murder within our cities the biggest in years we have a divided nation because people like her and believe me she has tremendous hate in her heart and when she said deplorables she meant it and when she said irredeemable they re irredeemable you didn t mention that but when she said they re irredeemable to me that might have been even worse "
"363","COOPER"," she said some of them are irredeemable "
"364","TRUMP"," she s got tremendous she s got tremendous hatred and this country cannot take another four years of barack obama and that s what you re getting with her "
"365","COOPER"," mr trump let me follow up with you in you wrote in one of your books that the most important characteristic of a good leader is discipline you said if a leader doesn t have it quote he or she won t be one for very long in the days after the first debate you sent out a series of tweets from a m to a m including one that told people to check out a sex tape is that the discipline of a good leader "
"366","TRUMP"," no there wasn t check out a sex tape it was just take a look at the person that she built up to be this wonderful girl scout who was no girl scout "
"367","COOPER"," you mentioned sex tape "
"368","TRUMP"," by the way just so you understand when she said o clock in the morning take a look at benghazi she said who is going to answer the call at o clock in the morning guess what she didn t answer it because when ambassador stevens"
"369","COOPER"," the question is is that the discipline of a good leader "
"370","TRUMP"," wait a minute anderson times well she said she was awake at o clock in the morning and she also sent a tweet out at o clock in the morning but i won t even mention that but she said she ll be awake who s going the famous thing we re going to answer our call at o clock in the morning guess what happened ambassador stevens ambassador stevens sent requests for help and the only one she talked to was sidney blumenthal who s her friend and not a good guy by the way so you know she shouldn t be talking about that "
"371","TRUMP","now tweeting happens to be a modern day form of communication i mean you can like it or not like it i have between facebook and twitter i have almost million people it s a very effective way of communication so you can put it down but it is a very effective form of communication i m not un proud of it to be honest with you "
"372","COOPER"," secretary clinton does mr trump have the discipline to be a good leader "
"373","CLINTON"," no "
"374","TRUMP"," i m shocked to hear that "
"375","CLINTON"," well it s not only my opinion it s the opinion of many others national security experts republicans former republican members of congress but it s in part because those of us who have had the great privilege of seeing this job up close and know how difficult it is and it s not just because i watched my husband take a billion deficit and turn it into a billion surplus and million new jobs were created and incomes went up for everybody everybody african american incomes went up percent "
"376","CLINTON","and it s not just because i worked with george w bush after and i was very proud that when i told him what the city needed what we needed to recover he said you ve got it and he never wavered he stuck with me "
"377","CLINTON","and i have worked and i admire president obama he inherited the worst financial crisis since the great depression that was a terrible time for our country "
"378","COOPER"," we have to move along "
"379","CLINTON"," nine million people lost their jobs "
"380","RADDATZ"," secretary clinton we have to"
"381","CLINTON"," five million homes were lost "
"382","RADDATZ"," secretary clinton we re moving "
"383","CLINTON"," and trillion in family wealth was wiped out we are back on the right track he would send us back into recession with his tax plans that benefit the wealthiest of americans "
"384","RADDATZ"," secretary clinton we are moving to an audience question we re almost out of time we have another"
"385","TRUMP"," we have the slowest growth since "
"386","RADDATZ"," we re moving to an audience question "
"387","TRUMP"," it is our country has the slowest growth and jobs are a disaster "
"388","RADDATZ"," mr trump secretary clinton we want to get to the audience thank you very much both of you "
"389","RADDATZ","we have another audience question beth miller has a question for both candidates "
"390","AUDIENCE"," good evening perhaps the most important aspect of this election is the supreme court justice what would you prioritize as the most important aspect of selecting a supreme court justice "
"391","RADDATZ"," we begin with your two minutes secretary clinton "
"392","CLINTON"," thank you well you re right this is one of the most important issues in this election i want to appoint supreme court justices who understand the way the world really works who have real life experience who have not just been in a big law firm and maybe clerked for a judge and then gotten on the bench but you know maybe they tried some more cases they actually understand what people are up against "
"393","CLINTON","because i think the current court has gone in the wrong direction and so i would want to see the supreme court reverse citizens united and get dark unaccountable money out of our politics donald doesn t agree with that "
"394","CLINTON","i would like the supreme court to understand that voting rights are still a big problem in many parts of our country that we don t always do everything we can to make it possible for people of color and older people and young people to be able to exercise their franchise i want a supreme court that will stick with roe v wade and a woman s right to choose and i want a supreme court that will stick with marriage equality "
"395","CLINTON","now donald has put forth the names of some people that he would consider and among the ones that he has suggested are people who would reverse roe v wade and reverse marriage equality i think that would be a terrible mistake and would take us backwards "
"396","CLINTON","i want a supreme court that doesn t always side with corporate interests i want a supreme court that understands because you re wealthy and you can give more money to something doesn t mean you have any more rights or should have any more rights than anybody else "
"397","CLINTON","so i have very clear views about what i want to see to kind of change the balance on the supreme court and i regret deeply that the senate has not done its job and they have not permitted a vote on the person that president obama a highly qualified person they ve not given him a vote to be able to be have the full complement of nine supreme court justices i think that was a dereliction of duty "
"398","CLINTON","i hope that they will see their way to doing it but if i am so fortunate enough as to be president i will immediately move to make sure that we fill that we have nine justices that get to work on behalf of our people "
"399","RADDATZ"," thank you secretary clinton thank you you re out of time mr trump "
"400","TRUMP"," justice scalia great judge died recently and we have a vacancy i am looking to appoint judges very much in the mold of justice scalia i m looking for judges and i ve actually picked of them so that people would see highly respected highly thought of and actually very beautifully reviewed by just about everybody "
"401","TRUMP","but people that will respect the constitution of the united states and i think that this is so important also the second amendment which is totally under siege by people like hillary clinton they ll respect the second amendment and what it stands for what it represents so important to me "
"402","TRUMP","now hillary mentioned something about contributions just so you understand so i will have in my race more than million put in of my money meaning i m not taking all of this big money from all of these different corporations like she s doing what i ask is this "
"403","TRUMP","so i m putting in more than by the time it s finished i ll have more than million invested pretty much self funding money we re raising money for the republican party and we re doing tremendously on the small donations average or so "
"404","TRUMP","i ask hillary why doesn t she made million by being in office she used the power of her office to make a lot of money why isn t she funding not for million but why don t you put million or million or million or million into your own campaign "
"405","TRUMP","it s million less for special interests that will tell you exactly what to do and it would really i think be a nice sign to the american public why aren t you putting some money in you have a lot of it you ve made a lot of it because of the fact that you ve been in office made a lot of it while you were secretary of state actually so why aren t you putting money into your own campaign i m just curious "
"406","CLINTON"," well"
"407","RADDATZ"," thank you very much we re going to get on to one more question "
"408","CLINTON"," the question was about the supreme court and i just want to quickly say i respect the second amendment but i believe there should be comprehensive background checks and we should close the gun show loophole and close the online loophole "
"409","COOPER"," thank you "
"410","RADDATZ"," we have we have one more question mrs clinton "
"411","CLINTON"," we have to save as many lives as we possibly can "
"412","COOPER"," we have one more question from ken bone about energy policy ken "
"413","AUDIENCE"," what steps will your energy policy take to meet our energy needs while at the same time remaining environmentally friendly and minimizing job loss for fossil power plant workers "
"414","COOPER"," mr trump two minutes "
"415","TRUMP"," absolutely i think it s such a great question because energy is under siege by the obama administration under absolutely siege the environmental protection agency is killing these energy companies and foreign companies are now coming in buying our buying so many of our different plants and then re jiggering the plant so that they can take care of their oil "
"416","TRUMP","we are killing absolutely killing our energy business in this country now i m all for alternative forms of energy including wind including solar et cetera but we need much more than wind and solar "
"417","TRUMP","and you look at our miners hillary clinton wants to put all the miners out of business there is a thing called clean coal coal will last for years in this country now we have natural gas and so many other things because of technology we have unbelievable we have found over the last seven years we have found tremendous wealth right under our feet so good especially when you have trillion in debt "
"418","TRUMP","i will bring our energy companies back they ll be able to compete they ll make money they ll pay off our national debt they ll pay off our tremendous budget deficits which are tremendous but we are putting our energy companies out of business we have to bring back our workers "
"419","TRUMP","you take a look at what s happening to steel and the cost of steel and china dumping vast amounts of steel all over the united states which essentially is killing our steelworkers and our steel companies we have to guard our energy companies we have to make it possible "
"420","TRUMP","the is so restrictive that they are putting our energy companies out of business and all you have to do is go to a great place like west virginia or places like ohio which is phenomenal or places like pennsylvania and you see what they re doing to the people miners and others in the energy business it s a disgrace "
"421","COOPER"," your time is up thank you "
"422","TRUMP"," it s an absolute disgrace "
"423","COOPER"," secretary clinton two minutes "
"424","CLINTON"," and actually well that was very interesting first of all china is illegally dumping steel in the united states and donald trump is buying it to build his buildings putting steelworkers and american steel plants out of business that s something that i fought against as a senator and that i would have a trade prosecutor to make sure that we don t get taken advantage of by china on steel or anything else "
"425","CLINTON","you know because it sounds like you re in the business or you re aware of people in the business you know that we are now for the first time ever energy independent we are not dependent upon the middle east but the middle east still controls a lot of the prices so the price of oil has been way down and that has had a damaging effect on a lot of the oil companies right we are however producing a lot of natural gas which serves as a bridge to more renewable fuels and i think that s an important transition "
"426","CLINTON","we ve got to remain energy independent it gives us much more power and freedom than to be worried about what goes on in the middle east we have enough worries over there without having to worry about that "
"427","CLINTON","so i have a comprehensive energy policy but it really does include fighting climate change because i think that is a serious problem and i support moving toward more clean renewable energy as quickly as we can because i think we can be the st century clean energy superpower and create millions of new jobs and businesses "
"428","CLINTON","but i also want to be sure that we don t leave people behind that s why i m the only candidate from the very beginning of this campaign who had a plan to help us revitalize coal country because those coal miners and their fathers and their grandfathers they dug that coal out a lot of them lost their lives they were injured but they turned the lights on and they powered their factories i don t want to walk away from them so we ve got to do something for them "
"429","COOPER"," secretary clinton"
"430","CLINTON"," but the price of coal is down worldwide so we have to look at this comprehensively "
"431","COOPER"," your time is up "
"432","CLINTON"," and that s exactly what i have proposed i hope you will go to hillaryclinton com and look at my entire policy "
"433","COOPER"," time is up we have time for one more"
"434","RADDATZ"," we have"
"435","COOPER"," one more audience question "
"436","RADDATZ"," we ve sneaked in one more question and it comes from karl becker "
"437","AUDIENCE"," good evening my question to both of you is regardless of the current rhetoric would either of you name one positive thing that you respect in one another "
"438","RADDATZ"," mr trump would you like to go first "
"439","CLINTON"," well i certainly will because i think that s a very fair and important question look i respect his children his children are incredibly able and devoted and i think that says a lot about donald i don t agree with nearly anything else he says or does but i do respect that and i think that is something that as a mother and a grandmother is very important to me "
"440","CLINTON","so i believe that this election has become in part so so conflict oriented so intense because there s a lot at stake this is not an ordinary time and this is not an ordinary election we are going to be choosing a president who will set policy for not just four or eight years but because of some of the important decisions we have to make here at home and around the world from the supreme court to energy and so much else and so there is a lot at stake it s one of the most consequential elections that we ve had "
"441","CLINTON","and that s why i ve tried to put forth specific policies and plans trying to get it off of the personal and put it on to what it is i want to do as president and that s why i hope people will check on that for themselves so that they can see that yes i ve spent years actually maybe a little more working to help kids and families and i want to take all that experience to the white house and do that every single day "
"442","RADDATZ"," mr trump "
"443","TRUMP"," well i consider her statement about my children to be a very nice compliment i don t know if it was meant to be a compliment but it is a great i m very proud of my children and they ve done a wonderful job and they ve been wonderful wonderful kids so i consider that a compliment "
"444","TRUMP","i will say this about hillary she doesn t quit she doesn t give up i respect that i tell it like it is she s a fighter i disagree with much of what she s fighting for i do disagree with her judgment in many cases but she does fight hard and she doesn t quit and she doesn t give up and i consider that to be a very good trait "
"445","RADDATZ"," thanks to both of you "
"446","COOPER"," we want to thank both the candidates we want to thank the university here this concludes the town hall meeting our thanks to the candidates the commission washington university and to everybody who watched "
"447","RADDATZ"," please tune in on october th for the final presidential debate that will take place at the university of nevada las vegas good night everyone "
